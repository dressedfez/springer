      The abstract serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a
      brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications.
      Authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they
      are submitting to for word limits and if structural elements like
      subheadings, citations, or equations are permitted.
  - id: acknowledgments
    required: false

      Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
  - id: appendix
    required: false
    description: >
      An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential
      part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more
      comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information
      that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.
  - id: declarations
    required: false
    description: >
      Some journals require declarations to be submitted in a standardised
      format. Please check the Instructions for Authors of the journal to which

        - Ethics approval 
        - Consent to participate
        - Consent for publication
        - Availability of data and materials
        - Code availability 
        - Authors' contributions
      If any of the sections are not relevant to your manuscript, please include
      the heading and %%write `Not applicable' for that section.
